# MUSA 550 Final Project

The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect poses significant challenges for public transit users, particularly those waiting at bus stops, where prolonged exposure to extreme heat can lead to serious health risks. Despite growing awareness of these dangers, limited research has examined hyperlocal heat stress levels around bus stops and their interaction with surrounding urban environments. To address this gap, this study utilizes Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) data throughout Philadelphia to analyze heat stress variations in the immediate vicinity of bus stops. The research focuses on exploring the spatial-temporal patterns of heat stress, including daily temporal fluctuations and spatial clustering to identify hotspots and cold spots. Additionally, various socio-economic and urban built form variables were incorporated to examine their relationship with heat stress. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model was then developed to quantify and clarify the influence of these variables on localized heat stress levels.
