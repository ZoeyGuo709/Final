## Welcome!

This website presents our research on heat stress around bus stops and explores the factors contributing to its occurrence.

The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect poses significant challenges to public transit users, especially those waiting at bus stops, where prolonged exposure to extreme heat can result in serious health risks. Despite growing awareness of these dangers, there remains a lack of research examining hyperlocal heat stress levels around bus stops and their interactions with surrounding urban environments. To address this gap, this study leverages Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) data across Philadelphia to analyze heat stress variations in the immediate vicinity of bus stops. This research aims to investigate heat stress around bus stops in Philadelphia, focusing on its spatial-temporal patterns. The study includes a temporal analysis of heat stress variations throughout the day and a spatial exploration, identifying hotspots and cold spots through clustering analysis. To understand the underlying factors contributing to these patterns, we incorporated various socio-economic and urban built form variables to examine their relationship with heat stress. By developing an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, we aim to quantify and identify the relationships between these variables and heat stress.
